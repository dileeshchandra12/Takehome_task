    "## Task 2, 3: Identify company acquired and company making the acquisition\n",
    "The task at hand is to find the company being acquired and the company which is making the acquisition along with the amount involved in the acquisition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ideas for Task\n",
    "To help us identify that we have news articles as well as their titles which can help us.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Using Word2Vec\n",
    "We can use create a Word2vec model and then retrain it over all the news articles that we have in the dataset. This might help us learn embeddings like:\n",
    " - king is to queen like father is to mother.\n",
    " - acquirer is to acquired ; like ; acquired is to acquirer\n",
    " - CompanyA is to CompanyB ; like ; CompanyC is to CompanyD\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the techniques such as cbow and skipgrams can help us to understand context.\n",
    "Then we can probably try to use these vector embeddings to find the company which was acquired and the company which acquired using these. Cosine similarity distance can be extracted using Python gensim library.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Entity Tagging\n",
    "Using a pre-trained machine learning/ deep learning model to identify company names in the text. This can help us find out the company acquired and the company making the acquisition.\n",
    "\n",
    "To distinguish between the companies we can try to develop some understanding about the words contained in the title and if they can possibly help us identify that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Few pretrained models using NER include\n",
    "- https://github.com/deepmipt/ner\n",
    "- https://medium.com/intro-to-artificial-intelligence/entity-extraction-using-deep-learning-8014acac6bb8\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Sequential Learning\n",
    "This particular problem would be difficult to solve with a rule-based method because we need to find the company being acquired and the company which is making the acquisition, in any order. Hence we need to capture the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps\n",
    "- Extract all the topic bodies\n",
    "- We would need to label the data values so that we can apply customize NER such as CompanyA and CompanyB\n",
    "- Make a tuple for each word (word-tokenize or POS tagging)\n",
    "- Keep adding different tags such as (Brown Disc Products Co Inc, Noun, O) - Company represented as \"O\"\n",
    "- Model using following methods once labelling is complete\n",
    "    - CRF\n",
    "    - RNN with LSTM\n",
    "\n",
    "There are possibly other techniques that can be explored so as to come up with a better approach. But could not get time to explore further due to time constraint."
